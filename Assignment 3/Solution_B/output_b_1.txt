Matrix after pivoting (Step 1):
  11.0   9.0   5.0  30.0
   6.0   9.0   2.0  19.0
   5.0   6.0   9.0  29.0
Matrix after pivoting (Step 2):
  11.0   9.0   5.0  30.0
  -0.0   4.1  -0.7   2.6
  -0.0   1.9   6.7  15.4
Matrix after forward elimination:
  11.0   9.0   5.0  30.0
  -0.0   4.1  -0.7   2.6
  -0.0   0.0   7.1  14.1
The solution is:
x1 =   1.00
x2 =   1.00
x3 =   2.00
